# Price_Praydictator
Price_Praydictator is an automated stock price predictor and trading assistant for the Indian stock market, using PyTorch for predictions and real-time data from the Upstox API. It provides a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard for tracking live prices and viewing predictions, with potential future trading capabilities.

Installation and Setup
To use Price_Praydictator, clone the repository from GitHub, set up a virtual environment, and install dependencies like PyTorch and Streamlit. You'll need Upstox API credentials, which you can get from Upstox Developer Portal. Set these as environment variables and run the app with streamlit run app.py.

Usage
The dashboard shows live stock prices (e.g., Nifty 50) and predicted prices, updating every second. It's designed for educational purposes, with a focus on prediction, and includes disclaimers about trading risks.

Comprehensive Response: Automated Stock Price Predictor and Trading Assistant for Indian Stock Market
The task of creating a README for "Price_Praydictator," an automated PyTorch-based price analyzer with prediction and trading capabilities for the Indian stock market, involves detailing its features, installation, usage, and technical aspects. This response outlines a comprehensive implementation, leveraging the Upstox API for data, PyTorch for modeling, and Streamlit for visualization, tailored for the Indian market as of 10:37 AM PDT on Monday, April 14, 2025.

Background and Significance
Stock price prediction is a critical application in financial analysis, aiding investors in making informed decisions. The Indian stock market, primarily comprising the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), requires real-time data for accurate predictions. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, part of PyTorch, are effective for time series forecasting due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies, making them suitable for stock price prediction. The project, named "Price_Praydictator," aims to provide an automated tool for prediction and potential trading, focusing on accessibility and usability for Indian investors.

Project Description and Features
Price_Praydictator is designed as an automated stock price predictor and trading assistant, leveraging real-time data from the Upstox API and PyTorch for predictive modeling. Its key features include:

Real-time Stock Price Tracking: Utilizes Upstox API's WebSocket for live market data updates, ensuring users can track prices in real-time.
Predictive Modeling: Employs PyTorch-based LSTM models to forecast future stock prices based on historical and real-time data, using a 60-minute sequence for predictions.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Built with Streamlit, providing an intuitive interface to visualize live prices, predictions, and historical trends, updating every second for immediate feedback.
Trading Integration (Future Feature): Designed to integrate with Upstox API for order placement, enabling automated or manual trading based on predictions, though currently focused on prediction with potential for future expansion.
The project is tailored for the Indian market, using APIs like Upstox, which provides access to real-time and historical data from NSE and BSE. It is primarily educational, with a focus on prediction accuracy, and includes disclaimers about trading risks due to the inherent uncertainties in financial markets.

Installation and Setup
To set up Price_Praydictator, users need to follow these steps:

Prerequisites: Ensure Python 3.8 or later is installed. Obtain Upstox API credentials by registering an app on the Upstox Developer Portal, which provides API key, secret, and session token, valid for 24 hours and renewable as needed.
Cloning and Environment Setup:
Clone the repository using:
bash

Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Price_Praydictator.git
cd Price_Praydictator
Set up a virtual environment:
bash

Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies from requirements.txt:
bash

Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes:
text

Copy
upstox-python-sdk
torch
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy
streamlit
plotly
Note: The upstox-python-sdk may need installation from GitHub if not available on PyPI; check Upstox SDK documentation for details.
Configuration: Set environment variables for API credentials:
UPSTOX_API_KEY
UPSTOX_API_SECRET
UPSTOX_SESSION_TOKEN
Example:
bash

Copy
export UPSTOX_API_KEY=your_api_key
export UPSTOX_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
export UPSTOX_SESSION_TOKEN=your_session_token
Usage and Operation
To run the application, execute:

bash

Copy
streamlit run app.py
The dashboard will display:

Live stock prices (e.g., for Nifty 50), updated via WebSocket every second.
Predicted next price based on the trained LSTM model, using the most recent 60 LTPs.
Historical price trends, if implemented, for context.
The interface is designed for ease of use, with metrics showing live and predicted prices, and potential for selecting different stocks if supported. Users can explore predictions in real-time, with updates reflecting market movements immediately.

Model Architecture and Technical Details
The predictive model uses an LSTM network implemented in PyTorch, designed for time series forecasting. The architecture includes:

Input: Historical 1-minute candle data (e.g., closing prices) fetched from the Upstox API, normalized using Min-Max scaling.
Sequence Length: Uses the past 60 minutes of data to predict the next minute's price, creating sequences for training.
Training: The model is trained on a dataset split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function and Adam as the optimizer, with 100 epochs for convergence.
Live Prediction: For real-time predictions, the model uses the most recent 60 Last Traded Prices (LTPs) from the WebSocket feed, scaled and fed into the model, with inverse transformation for display.
Note: There may be a slight discrepancy between historical candle data and real-time LTPs, potentially affecting prediction accuracy. For optimal performance, consider aggregating real-time ticks into 1-minute candles to match the training data format, though this is more complex and not implemented in the current version.

The model is trained within the main script for simplicity, but for production use, consider training offline on larger datasets and loading pre-trained weights to improve efficiency and scalability.
